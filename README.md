# Tank-Battles
We are heading back to the Wii-era with this 2-player tank action game making use of a PS2 keyboard, 2 joysticks, and 2 arcade buttons! In this game, 2 tanks
are displayed using a birds-eye 2-D view within a maze-like map. Each tank is spawned into
random locations in this map (without overlapping with boundaries). Using 8 keys (4 per player) on the PS2 keyboard, as
well as 2 joysticks (for cannon rotation) and 2 buttons (for cannon shooting), each player can
navigate the battlefield and rotate their tank cannon (using the joystick) to attack the enemy
player (3 lives will be allocated per tank). 

# Next Steps
To add extra flavour to the game, power-ups can be added! Examples include ricochet bullets that bounce off walls several times (be careful because your own bullets can
still hurt your tank), bomb bullets that hit anything within a certain vicinity of its explosion,
speedy bullets (faster bullet speed), slowness bullets (normal bullet speed, but will slow tank
movement & cannon rotation if it hits a tank), and potentially more.

And if you do not happen to have access to the hardware needed for the current application, modifications can be made to work on basic laptop/desktop keyboards!

Finally, extra add-ons could be created, such as a countdown timer and a 1-player mode against waves of computer opponents!
